## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, part 1
This was an enjoyable lab because we learned how to print statements. This lab also allowed for my lab partner and I to be familiarized with the syntax that is used in C++. We also learned key funcamentals that are used in debugging which is using print statements. 

* Lab 5, part 1
This was a tough lab since we had to apply something new that was learned during the lectures into the labs. I learned the syntax for using functions from different programs but have never put it into use before. This lab allowed me to learn how to use functions from different programs and how to reference them and put them into headers. 

* Lab 3, part 1
In this lab, I learned how to use operations and operands in C++. This was through performing the task of calculating the BMR of a man and a woman. This taught me how to order the operations and how to call functions.
